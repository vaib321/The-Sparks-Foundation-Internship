# GADUATE ROTATIONAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (GRIP)
The Sparks Foundation offers one month Internship program to the students in different fields:

Data Science and Analytics.
Web Development.
App Development.
Business Analytics.
During this internship program, they assigned me 5 Tasks with a deadline before which we have to submit the task by hosting a GitHub Repository. Along with this repository we have to also post our task in the LinkedIn and Telegram group of the organisation.

This internship program donot focus only on our technical skills infact it also help us to increase our social interaction and bonding by there tasks. The 5 tasks which were assigned to me was:

1. LinkedIn Improvement Task.
2. To explore Supervised Learning.
3. To explore Unsupervised Learning.
4. To explore Decision Tree Algorithm.
5. To explore Business Analytics.  
# TASK-1 Improve our LinkedIn profile.  
# TASK-2 To Explore Supervised Machine Learning 
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.  
# TASK-3 To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning 
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.  
# TASK-4 To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm 
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.  
# TASK-5 To explore Business Analytics 
Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’. You are the business owner of the retail firm and want to see how your company is performing. You are interested in finding out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. What all business problems you can derive by looking into the data? You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)
